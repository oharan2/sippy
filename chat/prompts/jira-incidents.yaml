prompt: |
  List all currently open Jira incidents and provide a summary of what's happening.

  Use the check_known_incidents tool to retrieve the list of active incidents.

  For each open incident, provide:
  1. **Issue Key**: Link to the Jira issue
  2. **Summary**: The incident title/summary
  3. **Status**: Current status of the incident
  4. **Opened**: When the incident was opened (format as human-readable date with "days/hours ago")
  5. **Impact**: Brief description of what's affected based on the incident description
  6. **Affected Tests/Jobs**: Key tests or jobs that are impacted (if available in the incident data)

  After listing all incidents, provide a brief overall summary highlighting:
  - Total number of open incidents
  - Any particularly critical or widespread issues
  - Recent trends (newly opened vs. long-standing incidents)

  If there are no open incidents, provide a cheerful message with emojis indicating that everything is healthy.

  Use markdown formatting for readability and include direct links to Jira issues.
